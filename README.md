## Steps to bootstrap a new Mac

1. Install Apple's Command Line Tools, which are prerequisites for Git and Homebrew.
```zsh
xcode-select --install
```

2. Clone repo into new hidden directory.
Setup SSH to Github using online guide. Then use SSH to clone dotfiles:

```zsh
# Use HTTPS to clone
git clone [SSH link] ~/.dotfiles
```

3. Run install script
```zsh
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

4. Install LaTeX on the [MacTex website](https://tug.org/mactex/)

6. Add [this firacode NF font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)
   to iterm2.app after installation (works better with oh-my-zsh)

 
## TODO List

- Learn how to use [`defaults`](https://macos-defaults.com/#%F0%9F%99%8B-what-s-a-defaults-command) to record and restore System Preferences and other macOS configurations.
- Organize these growing steps into multiple script files.
- Automate symlinking and run script files with a bootstrapping tool like [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
- Revisit the list in [`.zshrc`](.zshrc) to customize the shell.
- Make a checklist of steps to decommission your computer before wiping your hard drive.
- Create a [bootable USB installer for macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372).
- Integrate other cloud services into your Dotfiles process (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.).
- Find inspiration and examples in other Dotfiles repositories at [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
- And last, but hopefully not least, [**take my course, *Dotfiles from Start to Finish-ish***](https://www.udemy.com/course/dotfiles-from-start-to-finish-ish/?referralCode=445BE0B541C48FE85276 "Learn Dotfiles from Start to Finish-ish on Udemy"
